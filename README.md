My Advent of Code solutions.

Lessons Learned in 2016
-----------------------

* Spend time reading and understanding the problem, then think about the data
  structure or algorithm that best represents the problem, even if it requires
  doing a lot of research and learning, and only _then_ begin writing any code.
  
* Regular expressions may seem like a good idea but very rarely provide
  time-efficient value, in particular writing a parser with a regular expression
  is almost always a bad idea. Use sparingly.
